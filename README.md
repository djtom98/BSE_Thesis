# BSE Thesis
This is a work in progress of Davis Thomas, Lucas Costa and Vicente Lisboa as their master's thesis at the Barcelona School of Economics.
Broadly, the goal is to predict stock price movement of selected publically trading pharma companies using NLP techniques and tools learnt during the coursework of the masters. This thesis is being done in collaboration with Novartis, who have been kind enough to present us with this challenge, and who have taken on a guiding role throughout this project.
