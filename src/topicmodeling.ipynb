       " \"Frank will review the numbers for the quarter and the year in a few moments, but I'd like to just make a few opening remarks.\",\n",
       " 'When I took this position it was clear that fundamental change was imperative at Pfizer.',\n",
       " 'The tough decisions had to be made, and that we had to act with a sense of urgency.',\n",
       " 'We faced an environment where our traditional business model had come under attack.',\n",
       " 'We saw a company facing significant losses of exclusivity, weighed down by layers of bureaucracy, slow to make decisions and in many cases at odds with regulators, payers and policymakers.',\n",
       " 'For success in the decade ahead, we needed to get our house in order, and we needed to get moving.',\n",
       " 'We knew that quick fixes were simply not the answer.',\n",
       " 'We set out to create a company that has the advantages of global scale, but also the agility, speed and decisiveness of a small enterprise.',\n",
       " \"One year ago, we announced a set of immediate priorities to rebuild the foundation of our business and improve Pfizer's performance.\",\n",
       " 'These set the stage for the sweeping changes that Pfizer needs to make in order to succeed in the changing industry.',\n",
       " 'Today while we still have a lot of work to do, we are in a much stronger position to meet our challenges and capitalize on our opportunities than we were one year ago.',\n",
       " 'We achieved both revenue and adjusted diluted earnings per share growth in 2007, despite losing U.S. market exclusivity for Norvasc and Zoloft while making important structural and operating changes to enhance our future performance.',\n",
       " 'We did this with solid product performance across a broad and diverse portfolio, cost reductions and the benefits of foreign exchange.',\n",
       " 'By the end of last year, we had in place our new leadership team, and I am particularly pleased with the group that we have assembled.',\n",
       " 'It has in my view a good balance between leaders with strong and extensive experience in our industry, and people from other industries who bring fresh ideas and perspectives.',\n",
       " 'Each member of our team fully appreciates what we need to do and is fully aligned behind our plans to achieve success.',\n",
       " \"Before turning it over to Frank, I'd like to briefly highlight how we're making progress against our priorities and outline the next phase of our plan which we'll cover in much more detail at our March 5th analyst meeting.\",\n",
       " 'Our five priorities last January were: first, maximize revenues in both the short and the long term.',\n",
       " 'Second, establish a lower and more flexible cost base.',\n",
       " 'Third, create smaller, more focused and accountable business units.',\n",
       " 'Fourth, build more collaborative relationships to deliver greater value for patients, physicians and customers, and fifth, make Pfizer a great place to work.',\n",
       " 'On our first priority, we are maximizing revenues from both our new products as well as our current in-line portfolio.',\n",
       " 'Three new products are noteworthy.',\n",
       " 'Lyrica, an innovative treatment for diabetic nerve pain and post-herpetic neuralgia, and now the first medicine to ever win FDA approval for the management of fibromyalgia.',\n",
       " 'Sutent, a breakthrough way to fight too tough-to-treat cancers and a drug with the potential to treat other devastating cancers, including breast cancer.',\n",
       " 'And Chantix, which has now been tried by more than 5 million smokers and is growing rapidly worldwide.',\n",
       " 'Meanwhile, Lipitor continues to hold its own, generating sales only slightly less than last year despite an unprecedented commercial and competitive attack.',\n",
       " 'Even now after ten years, new data still comes in showing why it remains the industry leader.',\n",
       " 'And we have a host of other innovative products doing well, like Celebrex, Geodon and Zyvox, and our animal health business continues to deliver outstanding performance.',\n",
       " 'In terms of future revenues, in 2007 we accelerated a new compound for generalized anxiety disorder into Phase III and moved three high value oncology indications, melanoma, breast and lung cancer into Phase III.',\n",
       " \"We're also moving forward aggressively on the largest Phase II portfolio in Pfizer's history.\",\n",
       " \"And to supplement our efforts internally, we've revamped our business development group to capitalize on external opportunities like our apixaban collaboration with Bristol-Myers Squibb.\",\n",
       " 'We entered into 14 deals last year.',\n",
       " 'These include our acquisitions of BioRexis with its diabetes candidates and novel peptide technology platform, Coley Pharmaceutical Group with its vaccine adjuvant technology and a new class of drug candidates, and CovX which will substantially enhance our biotherapeutics capabilities.',\n",
       " 'We also entered into an important collaboration with Adolor to develop two novel compounds for the treatment of pain, a therapeutic area in which we already have a strong and leading position.',\n",
       " 'To deliver on our second priority, establishing a smaller, more flexible cost base, we took some tough actions last year including a 10% reduction in our global workforce and 20% in the U.S. sales force.',\n",
       " 'We said we would do everything possible to minimize disruptions to our business, and we did.',\n",
       " \"It's worth noting that even with all of the changes this year our U.S sales force was once again ranked the best in the industry by physicians for the 13th year in a row.\",\n",
       " 'And our terrific sales people around the world are earning similar recognitions.',\n",
       " 'To enhance R&D efficiency and productivity, we closed two U.S. R&D sites and announced the closure of three international sites.',\n",
       " 'We streamlined our therapeutic area structure and cut the layers of management in PGRD between myself and the bench scientists from 13 to 8.',\n",
       " 'In manufacturing, we exited six sites in 2007 and plan to exit 12 more.',\n",
       " 'And we achieved significant production cost reductions on key products.',\n",
       " 'These actions were painful, but they were necessary.',\n",
       " \"We significantly cut costs in 2007, and we're on track to achieve absolute reductions of our total adjusted costs next year of between $1.5 billion and $2 billion on a constant currency basis compared to 2006.\",\n",
       " 'To create smaller and more accountable business units, our third priority, we created five separate business units in the U.S. for our patent protected portfolio.',\n",
       " 'The new U.S. business units already have lots of success stories demonstrating their new agility and speed.',\n",
       " 'We also recently established a new separate unit focused solely on optimizing the performance of our established products, products that are near or past their loss of exclusivity.',\n",
       " 'This new unit is led by a skilled executive with substantial pharmaceutical experience around the world, including end markets where these established products are very successful.',\n",
       " 'In R&D, we put each therapeutic area in a single location allowing colleagues to have a clear line of sight to a smaller more focused enterprise.',\n",
